'''3. Write a Python program to print the square and cube symbol in the 
area of a rectangle and volume of a cylinder. 
Sample output:
The area of the rectangle is 1256.66cm2
The volume of the cylinder is 1254.725cm3'''

area = 1256.66
volume = 1254.725
print(f"The area of the rectangle is {round(area, 2)}cm2")
print(f"The volume of the cylinder is {round(volume, 3)}cm3")
